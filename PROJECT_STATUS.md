### Key Files Created
- **Configuration**: `master.yaml`, `bot.yaml`
- **Docker**: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- **Testing**: Complete integration test suite
- **Documentation**: README files for deployment and testing
- **Automation**: `Makefile`, `run_tests.sh`

## Running the System

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Or build locally
make build

# Run tests
make test

# Generate coverage report
make test-coverage
```

### Scaling
```bash
# Scale to 10 bots
docker-compose up -d --scale bot=10

# Monitor system
docker-compose logs -f
```

## Architecture Highlights

### Master Server
- RESTful API on port 8080
- Prometheus metrics on port 9090
- SQLite database for persistence
- Job scheduling with priorities
- Bot lifecycle management
- Automatic recovery procedures

### Bot Agent
- Autonomous operation
- Heartbeat mechanism
- Multiple fuzzer support
- Crash deduplication
- Resource limits
- Graceful shutdown

### Communication
- HTTP/JSON protocol
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Timeout handling
- Error recovery

## Next Steps

The PandaFuzz platform is production-ready. Potential enhancements:

1. **Web UI**: Dashboard for monitoring and control
2. **Cloud Integration**: AWS/GCP/Azure deployment templates
3. **Advanced Analytics**: ML-based crash clustering
4. **More Fuzzers**: Honggfuzz, Radamsa integration
5. **Kubernetes**: Helm charts for K8s deployment

## Conclusion

PandaFuzz provides a robust, scalable platform for distributed fuzzing with:
- High availability through recovery mechanisms
- Horizontal scalability with multiple bots
- Comprehensive crash analysis
- Production-ready deployment options
- Extensive test coverage

The system is ready for deployment and fuzzing real-world targets! 🐼🎯
